### Functionality - 3.5 out of 4
  - I failed to create a dynamic version of crack but the one I built will crack the test version.

### OOP - 3 out of 4
  - I created two modules and have one main class. I kept my methods slim with the exception of the crack method, which is over seven lines long. I feel like creating additional classes overcomplicates things, but I would be interested in seeing how classes are used in an efficient way.

### TTD - 3 out of 4
  - I used pry heavily throughout this project (and the last). The tests themselves are straight forward but in order to build out a fully functioning algorithm I needed each step to produce the correct results. The rubric is very focused on TDD in the sense of building out tests, but I think an unmeasurable metric related to TDD is pry usage. I didn't test for date and rand number because they change. I didn't test crack helper methods because theoretically they results would change.
